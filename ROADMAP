Organic Typing Roadmap

Organic typing evolves through careful expansion of its capabilities. Each phase builds on the foundation of authentic signal capture, ensuring that the system remains true to human rhythm and flow.

Recommendation

Prioritize platform support and model refinement to broaden the reach of organic typing. Focus on collecting diverse datasets while maintaining security and privacy.

Completed

The core system now captures keystrokes from terminal and system-wide on Ubuntu. Data flows through normalization, encoding into vectors, and generation of organic text. CLI commands enable generation, verification, and collection with full test coverage.

A recent addition enables system-wide capture on Ubuntu, accessing raw input events to record every keystroke across applications. This enhances data collection beyond terminal boundaries, providing richer organic signatures.

In Progress

Testing infrastructure solidifies with unit and integration tests. CI/CD ensures reliability across environments, with platform-specific handling for Linux features.

Planned

Expansion to additional platforms like macOS and Windows will require native input APIs. Web-based collection for browsers could use JavaScript event listeners. Model improvements demand larger, varied datasets for better generalization.

Real-time verification APIs and expanded documentation will make organic typing more accessible. Performance optimizations will handle high-volume typing data efficiently.

Future

Mobile applications could analyze typing on touchscreens, adapting to gesture-based input. Integration with editors and IDEs would provide seamless organic feedback. Advanced dashboards might visualize typing patterns over time.

Eventually, releasing open datasets for research could accelerate keystroke dynamics studies, fostering community contributions to organic typing science.
