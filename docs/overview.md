# Overview

Organic Typing captures the subtle signals that appear during real writing. Pauses, phrasing, rhythm, backspaces, and flow all contribute to a typing trace that reflects how a person naturally composes text.

Similarly, these signals reveal distinctions that are difficult for automated systems to imitate. They often expose the small variations that occur when someone thinks, hesitates, or shifts direction while typing.

**Recommendation**

Use Organic Typing to measure and preserve authentic writing behavior.

**Example**

When a user types a paragraph, the raw keystrokes include short bursts of activity, scattered pauses, and small corrections. These patterns form a signature that is stable across different topics and contexts.

A contrasting case appears when text is produced by an automated generator. The output may look fluent but the rhythm lacks variability. The absence of hesitation becomes a clear signal that the text did not originate from natural typing.

By comparing these two traces, Organic Typing can verify whether a passage aligns with a user’s established behavior.
