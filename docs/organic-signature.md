# Organic Signature

Typing patterns differ from one person to another. Small pauses, hesitation moments, and variations in rhythm combine to form a unique behavioral trace. These traces can be represented mathematically to capture a user’s organic style.

Similarly, analyzing these traces over time provides insight into consistency. Sudden changes may signal generated text or typing anomalies that deserve attention.

## Recommendation

Represent typing behavior as structured vectors that can be compared or reused for generation.

## Components

* **Timing Patterns**: Intervals between individual keystrokes.
* **Pauses**: Longer breaks associated with thinking or self-correction.
* **Rhythm Vectors**: Distributions of typing speeds over time.
* **Flow Signatures**: Metrics describing pacing, grouping, and natural phrasing.

## Usage

Organic signatures can be compared to detect unusual typing behavior.
They can also be used to guide models that aim to produce text with a human sense of timing and flow.
